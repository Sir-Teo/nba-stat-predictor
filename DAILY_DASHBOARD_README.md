# üèÄ NBA Daily Dashboard with Self-Improvement

A comprehensive daily dashboard that automatically improves your NBA stat prediction system through continuous performance monitoring and model retraining.

## üåü What Makes This Special

This isn't just a prediction dashboard - it's a **self-improving system** that:

- **Monitors its own performance** daily
- **Automatically retrains models** when accuracy drops
- **Learns from new data** continuously  
- **Provides actionable insights** for better predictions
- **Tracks improvement over time**

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Set up the dashboard system
make setup-dashboard

# Or manually:
python daily_dashboard.py setup
```

### 2. Daily Use
```bash
# Run your daily workflow (recommended)
make daily-dashboard

# Or manually:
python daily_dashboard.py daily
```

### 3. Check Status Anytime
```bash
# Quick health check
make status

# Performance metrics
make performance
```

## üîÑ The Self-Improvement Cycle

The dashboard runs an 8-step workflow each day:

### 1. **System Health Check** üè•
- Verifies database integrity
- Checks model availability
- Auto-repairs common issues

### 2. **Update Previous Results** üìä
- Fetches actual game results from past days
- Updates prediction accuracy records
- Builds performance history

### 3. **Performance Evaluation** üìà
- Calculates prediction accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE)
- Tracks confidence scores
- Compares recent vs historical performance

### 4. **Self-Improvement Check** üß†
- Detects performance degradation (>15% drop in accuracy)
- Ensures minimum time between retraining (7 days default)
- Triggers automatic improvement when needed

### 5. **Self-Improvement Process** üîÑ (when triggered)
- Collects additional training data
- Retrains all models with updated data
- Records retraining events for tracking

### 6. **Fresh Data Collection** üÜï
- Gathers latest player data
- Updates rosters and recent performance
- Prepares for today's predictions

### 7. **Generate Today's Predictions** üéØ
- Creates predictions for all games today
- Ranks players by stat categories
- Stores predictions with confidence scores

### 8. **Daily Report & Display** üìã
- Creates comprehensive daily report
- Shows beautiful formatted results
- Provides actionable recommendations

```

### Smart Recommendations
```
üí° RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------
  1. Points prediction accuracy could be improved (MAE: 5.2)
  2. Consider running backtests during off-season
```

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration

The dashboard uses your existing `config.yaml` with these key settings:

```yaml
models:
  retraining:
    performance_threshold: 0.15  # Retrain if accuracy drops 15%
    min_days_between_retraining: 7  # Wait at least 7 days

monitoring:
  accuracy_window_days: 14  # Track performance over 2 weeks
```

## üìÅ Generated Files

The dashboard creates several tracking files:

```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance_log.json      # Historical performance metrics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ last_retrain.json        # Last retraining information
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nba_data.db              # Main database

reports/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ daily_report_YYYYMMDD.json  # Daily reports archive

logs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ daily_dashboard.log       # Dashboard activity log
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ daily_run_*.log          # Automation script logs
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No games scheduled for today"**
- Normal during off-season or rest days
- Dashboard will still update previous results and check performance

**"Insufficient training data"** 
- Run: `make setup-dashboard` or `python daily_dashboard.py setup`
- The system will auto-collect data and train models

**"Missing trained models"**
- Auto-repair will trigger automatically
- Or manually run: `make train`

**Performance degradation detected**
- This is expected! The system will automatically retrain
- Monitor the self-improvement process in logs

### Manual Fixes

```bash
# Force data collection
python main.py collect-data --players-limit 150

# Force model retraining  
python main.py train

# Check accuracy manually
python main.py accuracy

# Reset performance tracking (if needed)
rm data/performance_log.json data/last_retrain.json
```

## üìà Monitoring Your System's Improvement

### Performance Tracking
The dashboard automatically tracks:
- **Prediction accuracy trends** over time
- **Model confidence scores** 
- **Retraining frequency** and triggers
- **Data freshness** and coverage

### Success Indicators
Look for:
- ‚úÖ Stable or improving MAE scores
- ‚úÖ High confidence scores (>0.7)
- ‚úÖ Successful auto-retraining events
- ‚úÖ Regular fresh data collection

### Warning Signs
Watch for:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consistently degrading accuracy
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Low confidence scores (<0.5)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Failed retraining attempts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Stale data (no recent updates)

## üéØ Best Practices

### Daily Usage
1. **Run the dashboard every morning** before games start
2. **Check recommendations** and act on them
3. **Monitor performance trends** weekly
4. **Review auto-improvement events** monthly

### Optimization Tips
1. **Let the system self-improve** - don't override too frequently
2. **Monitor during season transitions** for accuracy changes
3. **Adjust thresholds** in config.yaml based on your needs
4. **Keep historical data** for long-term trend analysis
